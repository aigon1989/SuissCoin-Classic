a.gonzalez - Compiling the wallet for Mac OSX Sierra: My fight, my proudness.  21-03-2018

1.- Look at Makefile in this file to know which dependencies you have to download using 
	brew install <package>

	miniupnpc
	berkley-db
	openssl
	qt
	db8
	qrencode

2.- Compile boost_1.55.0 using:
	./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local/boost-1.55.0
	sudo ./b2 cxxflags=-std=c++14 install

Make sure you use this version of boost, some files where modified to make them compilable by clang applying two patches as read here:

	https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/commit/6bb71fdd8f7cc346d90fb14beb38b7297fc1ffd9

3.- run qmake
4.- Replace Makefile on project root with Makefile on this folder
5.- Modify imports at INCPATH and LIBS in order to make it fit to your system and the libraries you have downloaded (special look at -L(lib) and -I(include) flags
6.- Run make clean if it's not your first attempt to compile (as it happened to me, that I needed countless trials and errors to compile this and make this guide).
7.- Run make
8.- ¡Et voilá!
